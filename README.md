# Ubiquitous Spoon

Ubiquitous Spoon is a full-stack recipe search app built using the PERN stack. It uses the Spoonacular API to find recipes based on ingredients.

## Description

The user can enter ingredients and find out what kinds of recipes they can make with the items they have available to them.

The user can also make an account, log in, and save recipes to their "favorites" list. They can set and change user food preferences.

Currently, food preferences do not influence recipes returned by the API, however in future versions of the project, we would like to use preferences such as gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian to limit API responses.

## Technologies Used

React/Redux/Hooks (for frontend/state management)
Ant Design (for styled React components)
NodeJS/ExpressJS (for server/middleware)
Postgres (for database)
Webpack
